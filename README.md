This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Installation

```git clone https://github.com/bpopovic42/react-technical-test && cd react-technical-test && npm install && npm start```

## Description

This is a React front-end using material UI and this API : "https://api.tvmaze.com/search/shows?q=test"  
I had 3 days to complete it without any prior experience in React  
The project had to adhere to these rules :
- A common header
- A common footer
- The main page has to offer a search bar
- Depending on the research, matching movies are displayed (thumbnail + title)
- Matching movies are clickable and lead to the second page
- The second page presents the movie's details
